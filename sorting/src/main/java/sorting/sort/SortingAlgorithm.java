/**
 * The essence of a sorting algorithm.
 * <p>
 * Note that in order to sort, some random type T would not be good enough.
 * Things to be sorted need an *order*, and we need a way to compare things,
 * not just for equality (there's an equals() method on all objects) but
 * for less-than and greater-than as well.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is why we need a *bounded* type parameter: Not just *any* T will do,
 * only those that are at least of type Comparable. That, in turn, ensures
 * that we have a method compareTo() that we can use to establish order. See
 * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html for
 * more.
 * </p>
